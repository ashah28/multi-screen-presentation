# multi-screen-presentation
Open a full-screen presentation in multiple monitors.

For full-screen multi-monitor presentations, it can be tedious to open all the browser windows, drag them to the appropriate monitor, and set them to full-screen. This app automatically opens the appropriate number of browser windows to the specified URLs and sets them to full-screen in the appropriate monitors. 

This extension was developed by Lincoln Belliston and updated by Alankrit Shah for the Decision Theater at Arizona State University.
